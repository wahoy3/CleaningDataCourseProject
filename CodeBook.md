## Project Description
Course project using Samsung S accelerometer and gyroscope data
 
##Study design and data processing

For all details please refer to [README file](README.md) within the same repository.
 
##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/
 
###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()
 
##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.
 
Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
 
##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.
 
##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
